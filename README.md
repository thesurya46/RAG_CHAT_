RAG-Powered Google Docs Chatbot A complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot that integrates with Google Docs using OAuth 2.0 authentication. Users can select documents from their Google Drive, add them to a knowledge base, and chat with their documents using AI.

Features 🔐 Google OAuth 2.0 Authentication: Secure login with Google accounts 📄 Google Docs Integration: Fetch and display user's Google Docs 🧠 Knowledge Base Management: Add selected documents to a searchable knowledge base 🤖 RAG Pipeline: Retrieval-Augmented Generation using vector embeddings 💬 Interactive Chat Interface: Clean, responsive web interface 🔍 Source Attribution: Shows which documents were used for answers ⚡ Fallback Mechanism: Uses general knowledge when documents don't contain the answer Architecture Backend: Python Flask with Google APIs Vector Database: FAISS for similarity search Embeddings: Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) LLM: Google Gemini API (with Hugging Face alternative) Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript with modern responsive design Setup Instructions

Prerequisites Python 3.8 or higher Google Cloud Console account Gemini API key (or Hugging Face API key)
Google Cloud Setup Go to Google Cloud Console Create a new project or select existing one Enable the following APIs: Google Drive API Google Docs API Create OAuth 2.0 credentials: Go to "Credentials" → "Create Credentials" → "OAuth 2.0 Client ID" Choose "Web application" Add authorized redirect URI: http://localhost:5000/oauth2callback Download the client configuration
Get Gemini API Key Go to Google AI Studio Create a new API key Copy the key for use in the application
Installation
Clone or create the project directory
mkdir rag-chatbot cd rag-chatbot

Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

Activate virtual environment
On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Create templates directory
mkdir templates 5. Configuration Edit app.py and update the following variables:

CLIENT_ID = 'your-google-client-id' # From Google Cloud Console CLIENT_SECRET = 'your-google-client-secret' # From Google Cloud Console GEMINI_API_KEY = 'your-gemini-api-key' # From Google AI Studio app.secret_key = 'your-secret-key-here' # Change this to a random string 6. File Structure Ensure your project has this structure:

rag-chatbot/ ├── app.py # Main Flask application ├── requirements.txt # Python dependencies ├── README.md # This file └── templates/ └── index.html # Frontend interface 7. Running the Application

Make sure virtual environment is activated
python app.py The application will start on http://localhost:5000

Usage Guide

Authentication Click "Sign in with Google" to authenticate with your Google account Grant permissions to access your Google Docs and Drive
Document Management View all your Google Docs in the sidebar Select documents you want to add to the knowledge base Click "Add Selected Documents" to process them
Chatting Once documents are added, the chat input will be enabled Ask questions about your documents in natural language The system will: Search your documents for relevant content Generate answers using the found information Fall back to general knowledge if no relevant content is found Show source documents when applicable
Knowledge Base Status Monitor how many documents and chunks are in your knowledge base See which documents have been processed API Endpoints GET / - Main application page GET /auth/google - Initiate Google OAuth flow GET /oauth2callback - OAuth callback handler GET /api/auth/status - Check authentication status GET /api/documents - List user's Google Docs POST /api/documents/add - Add documents to knowledge base POST /api/chat - Send chat message and get response GET /api/knowledge-base/status - Get knowledge base statistics GET /logout - Logout and clear session Technical Details RAG Pipeline Document Processing:
Extracts text from Google Docs (handles paragraphs and tables) Splits text into overlapping chunks (512 tokens with 50 token overlap) Creates embeddings using Sentence Transformers Vector Storage:

Uses FAISS for efficient similarity search Stores chunks with metadata (document name, ID, etc.) Implements cosine similarity for relevance scoring Retrieval & Generation:

Converts user queries to embeddings Searches for top-k similar chunks (threshold: 0.3) Provides context to Gemini API for answer generation Falls back to general knowledge if no relevant content found Security Features OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication Session management with Flask sessions Token refresh handling CORS protection Input validation and error handling Alternative LLM Configuration To use Hugging Face instead of Gemini:

Uncomment the Hugging Face sections in app.py Replace GEMINI_API_KEY with HF_API_KEY Update the chat() function to use generate_response_hf() Troubleshooting Common Issues OAuth Errors:

Verify redirect URI matches exactly Check client ID and secret Ensure APIs are enabled Import Errors:

Make sure virtual environment is activated Install all requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt API Errors:

Verify Gemini API key is correct and active Check API quotas and limits Document Processing Issues:

Ensure documents are Google Docs (not other formats) Check document permissions Logs and Debugging The application logs important events and errors. Check the console output for:

Authentication status Document processing progress API call results Error messages Deployment Notes For production deployment:

Use environment variables for sensitive data Set up proper SSL certificates Configure production WSGI server (Gunicorn included) Update redirect URIs for production domain Implement proper session storage (Redis/Database) Add rate limiting and monitoring License This project is open source and available under the MIT License.
